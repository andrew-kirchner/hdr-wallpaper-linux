# hello world
This is a simple bash script which displays HDR images and videos in their full colorspace on KDE Plasma using MPV. With some simple configurations to mpv it also tone maps SDR media, noticeably improving colors with minimized change in saturation or color accuracy. You do not necessarily need an HDR screen to take advantage of the image/video picker functionality, and desktop environments other than Plasma like GNOME will be supported soon.
